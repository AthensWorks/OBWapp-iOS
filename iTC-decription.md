Athensworks, in partnership with Ohio Brew Week, built this app for Ohio Brew Week 2015. All work was done by a group of volunteers and members of Athensworks in the context of a monthly event we call Hack Night. If you’re interested in Hack Night, checkout our Facebook Page each month. If you’re interested in a membership, we’d love to have you join Athensworks!
