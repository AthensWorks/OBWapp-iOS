# OBWapp-iOS
A Swift app for Ohio Brew Week (http://ohiobrewweek.com) that runs on iOS 8 devices.

This app communicates with the OBW Express.js app (https://github.com/AthensWorks/OBWapp-API).

To get started:

  1. Make sure you have the latest non-beta version of Xcode (v6.3.2 when last checked). 
  2. Clone this repo (I'd suggest the Mac GitHub client vs. using Xcode's built-in stuff)
  3. Install cocoapods (go to http://cocoapods.org if you need instructions on how to do this)
  4. Setup the necessary pods using the terminal by running `pod install` in the `Brew Week` directory inside the cloned repo (there should be a Podfile in that directory)
  5. Open the newly created Xcode workspace file called `Brew Week.xcworkspace`

Enjoy!
