# OBWapp-iOS
An app for OBW that runs on iOS devices.

This app communicates with the OBW node.js app (https://github.com/AthensWorks/OBWapp-API).

To get started:

  1. Make sure you have the latest non-beta version of Xcode (v6.3.2 when last checked). 
  2. Clone the repo (I'd suggest the mac Git-hub client vs. using Xcode's built in stuff)
  3. Install cocoapods (http://cocoapods.org if you don't already have it)
  4. Setup the necessary pods using the terminal by running `pod install` in the `Brew Week` directory (there should be a Podfile in that directory)
  5. Open the newly created Xcode workspace file called `Brew Week.xcworkspace`

Enjoy!
